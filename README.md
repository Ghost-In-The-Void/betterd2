How to install:

Currently BetterD2 is in a unpacked state for ease of editting but installtion is still easy follow these steps:
1. Download BetterD2
2. Place the contants in a folder named "BetterD2" (without the qoutes) in your "mods" folder in Diablo 2 Resurrected install path.
3. Create a shortcut to your D2R.exe located in your D2R install folder
4. Right click the shortcut you created and select properties
5. The line labled Target we need to add two commands to
6. In the Target line after D2R.exe" include these commands  -mod BetterD2 -txt
7. Your target line should look similar to this although your install location will most likely be different "D:\Bnet\Diablo II Resurrected\D2R.exe" -mod BetterD2 -txt
8. Now anytime you want to play D2R with the mod installed just launch the game from the shortcut. First launch will be like a new install of the game and you will have to set you settings up. You also will be notified of a que when logging in, just press ESC because you cannot play this mod online and will need to use local characters.



FAQ:
Will I get banned for using this mod?
A: No blizzard specifically states that mods can be used in single player as long as they do not inject directly into the process. This is literally just the original game files unpacked and reconfigured with some additional assets like new sprites.

How do I play this mod with my friends?
A: At this time there is no way to connect to friends via TCP/IP as it has been removed by blizzard. If and when this changes I will make sure my mod is ready.
