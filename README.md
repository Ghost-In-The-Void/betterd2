This is a mod for D2R. I am creating a mod that I think provides a few changes that greatly change the gameplay. I will list the current changes implemented and working, along with the future changes I plan on including at a later date.

List of Current modifications:

1. Magic Find Potion: "+150 Magic Find For 30 Seconds"

List of Planned changes to come :

1.Rune Drop Rate Increase
2.Stackable Gems/Runes
3.Show Item Lvl
4.Add Runewords that are not enabled
5.Add new "low level" runewords for the more commonly found runes
6.Add HoT pot
7.Better Colors for text
8.Better Charms
